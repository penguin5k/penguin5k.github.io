<h2>Why Penguin in the Park?<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Penguin in the Park 5K Run/Walk will be celebrating its milestone 15th anniversary in 2020! After his namesake, the Penguin, John Bingham, inspires us all to get out there and be active. Penguin in the Park is the largest (and friendliest) 5K in the Decatur area. This race embraces the Penguin in all of us — a race for the speedy, and those who want to take their time and enjoy the course! All proceeds will help benefit the <a href="http://www.decatur-parks.org/?page_id=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decatur Indoor Sports Center</a> youth programs and <a href="https://secure.touchnet.net/C21048_ustores/web/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCTID=529&amp;SINGLESTORE=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Millikin&#8217;s John &#8220;The Penguin&#8221; Bingham Scholarship</a>.</p>

We&#8217;re excited to have you participate in the 14th Penguin in the Park 5K on Saturday, March 30. If you haven&#8217;t registered yet, there is still time. You can register at Packet Pickup (read below) or prior to the race for $35.</p>
<p>The morning should be filled with enthusiasm, a great race course, and fellowship with fellow runners and walkers.  <strong>This email contains important information about packet pickup and race day, so please read on.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="subTitle"><span class="title"><em>Packet Pick Up</em></span></span></strong><br />
<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/25aa.png" alt="▪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Pick up your race packet on Friday at <a href="http://www.staleycu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.staleycu.com/">Staley Credit Union</a> on N. Woodford in Decatur between<strong> 11:00 am and 5:00 pm.</strong> <a href="/race-information/staley-credit-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="/race-information/staley-credit-union/">click here for directions</a>.

<p><strong><span class="subTitle"><em>Parking and Pre-Race</em></span></strong><br />
We are expecting large turnout this year, so parking will be difficult. We recommend that you park in one of the Millikin parking lots along Fairview Ave (in front of Kirkland Fine Arts Center or next to Westminster Church). <a href="https://millikin.edu/campus-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://millikin.edu/campus-maps">Click here for a campus map.</a> This will allow you easy access to both Fairview Park and Griswold Gym for the post-race party with a little warm-up and cool down walk to and from both locations.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/25aa.png" alt="▪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Prior to the race, Millikin&#8217;s student-run venture <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlueBrewCoffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/BlueBrewCoffee/">Blue Brew</a>, will be on site selling hot drinks to keep you warm and gear you up for the race.</p>

<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/25aa.png" alt="▪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The race is electronically timed by a &#8220;chip&#8221; that is integrated into your bib number. You must wear your bib on your<strong> front across your stomach (and visible)</strong>. Your bib DOES NOT have to be returned or the tag torn when you cross through the chute and is disposable. Remember, no bib&#8230; NO TIME!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/25aa.png" alt="▪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> A map of the race course can be found <a href="https://i1.wp.com/penguininthepark.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/racecourse2013.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://i1.wp.com/penguininthepark.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/racecourse2013.png">here</a></p>
<p><strong><em><span class="subTitle">Post-Race Party</span></em></strong><br />
When you are finished with the race, grab a cup of water and head over to Millikin&#8217;s Griswold Center for the post race party where you&#8217;ll find food, water provided by Pepsi, pasta, and famous Ray&#8217;s Chili.</p>
<p><strong>Check out the prize table</strong> to see if you have won a gift certificate or other goodies provided by our generous sponsors.</p>
<p>We will also have past Penguin in the Park 5K items for sale in addition to window decals designed and printed by Trump Direct. You may obtain a window decal for a donation into the John Bingham Scholarship Fund.</p>
<p>Remember that &#8220;The miracle isn&#8217;t that you finished. It&#8217;s that you had the courage to start.&#8221;<br />
We look forward to having you in Fairview Park this weekend and we&#8217;re excited about another great Penguin in the Park.</p>
