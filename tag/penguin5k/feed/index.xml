										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Penguin in the Park 5K Run/Walk will be celebrating its 10th anniversary on  March 28, 2015! The Penguin will be making a special return to his alma mater, Millikin University, in Decatur, Illinois since his official retirement announcement for a race that embraces the Penguin in all of us—a race for the speedy, and those who want to take their time and enjoy the course!</p>
<p>Starting at 9:00am, the race takes place in Fairview Park on a rolling bike path; afterwards, we move to the post-race party inside to Millikin’s Griswold Gym for awards, warm food, and inspiration from the Penguin.</p>
