       Penguin in the Park: The Next Chapter

	  <p>
	  Penguin in the Park has been successful over the past 17 years because of you, the participants, the sponsors, the volunteers, and most notably because of 
	  John Bingham's re-connection to his alma mater, Millikin University.  During that time, over $70,000 in proceeds have been given to support an endowed 
	  scholarship in John's name to entrepreneurship students in the Tabor School of Business at Millikin University and to support youth athletic programs 
	  through the Decatur Park District. 
	  <br><br>
	  It's been a joy to see so many achieve fitness goals, spend time with friends and family, and just be active because of Penguin in the Park. 
	  Beginning in 2023, Penguin in the Park, NFP, will become the sponsor of the last night of the Tuesday Night Park Run series in Fairview Park instead of a standalone 5K. 
	  The race has had a great run (pun intended), and we look forward to continuing to be a part of the running community and supporting our two worthy causes.
