										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a great day and perfect weather for a 5K in Fairview Park. Congratulations to all of the participants and thanks to all of our <a href="/community/">sponsors</a>. Check out to see how you and your fellow waddlers did on our <a href="/results/">results page</a>.</p>
<p>Penguin in the Park has been successful over the past 17 years because of you, the participants, the <a href="/community/">sponsors</a>, the <a href="/contact-us/about/">volunteers</a>, and most notably because of John Bingham&#8217;s re-connection to his alma mater, <a href="https://www.millikin.edu/">Millikin University</a>.  During that time, over $70,000 in proceeds have been given to support an endowed scholarship in John&#8217;s name to entrepreneurship students in the <a href="https://www.millikin.edu/tabor">Tabor School of Business</a> at Millikin University and to support youth athletic programs through the <a href="https://www.decatur-parks.org/">Decatur Park District</a>. It&#8217;s been a joy to see so many achieve fitness goals, spend time with friends and family, and just be active because of Penguin in the Park. Beginning in 2023, Penguin in the Park, NFP, will become the sponsor of the last night of the Tuesday Night Park Run series in Fairview Park instead of a standalone 5K. The race has had a great run (pun intended), and we look forward to continuing to be a part of the running community and supporting our two worthy causes. Thanks for waddling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Penguin in the Park 5K Run/Walk will be back and <strong>in person on October 10, 2021</strong>! After his namesake, the Penguin, John Bingham, inspires us all to get out there and be active. Penguin in the Park is the largest (and friendliest) 5K in the Decatur area. This race embraces the Penguin in all of us — a race for the speedy, and those who want to take their time and enjoy the course!</p>
<p>Starting at <strong>3:00 pm</strong>, the 5K race takes place in Fairview Park on a rolling bike path; afterwards, we will have a post-race party with awards, food, prizes, and entertainment in Fairview Pavilion.</p>
<p>This year will once again include the 300 meter <strong>Penguin Jr. Dash</strong> for the younger penguins that will take place before the start of the 5K at <strong>2:30 pm</strong>. This is a great opportunity to include youth in a sport and activity that is life long. Make Penguin in the Park a family activity this year. Penguin Dash participants will receive a short sleeve t-shirt and goody bag along with a finisher ribbon.</p>
<p>The race committee is committed to hosting the race in accordance with all CDC, state, and local health guidance. Prior to race day, detailed instructions will be sent regarding guidelines for participating in the race safely, which may include certain restrictions.</p>
